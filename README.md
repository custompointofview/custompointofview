### Hello there friend 👋

My name is Cosmin & I am a practicing polymath with a severe tendency of doing too many things at once.
I'm enthusiastic about reading, writing, film photography, drawing, illustration & painting, film criticism, teaching and mentoring, tech & tech philosophy.
I honestly hope this list will never end.
